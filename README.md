3D-Graphics-Engine
==================
This is my first time creating and experimenting with 3D Graphics.
My goal with this project is not to create the greatest engine possible,
but to fully understand how 3D graphics works.
The only library I am using is SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer).

## My goal with this
My passion in computer science has always been graphics and ui but since beginning my journey I havent done much of it. This summer in my free time I worked on this engine.
My initial goal (as strange as it sounds) was to be able to render Mario from Super Mario 64. In the process I learned so much about 3D graphics and what else goes into it that it transformed into
just experimenting and implenting as many 3D graphics features that I could figure out how to do.
Some of these features include: Backface culling, the Painter's Algorithm, Normals,Lighting, and more!



## Looking to the Future
In my next version of 3D-Graphics-Engine I would like to begin using OpenGL or another Graphics Library, since I did not do that in this one.
I also would like to work on a series of recreating this engine within other programming languages such as Java and Python.
